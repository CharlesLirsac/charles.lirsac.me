So... I am updating my personal site. I hate introductory posts, so I'll make it quick.

The name is Charles and I am currently taking a gap year from my Master's studies at [Centrale Lyon Engineering School][ecl] in France. I am also a Backend Engineering Intern at [Stylight][stylight]. You can find my complete resume [here](http://files.lirsac.me/resume/charles_lirsac_resume_01-2013.pdf) or on [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lirsacc).

Previously I had one page bio site, and 2 things prompted me to update :
+ I want to start writing again. I think last time I wrote for myself and not for school or internship search was a short story when I was 14... time to catch up as this post surely proves. It's also an effort to share more and be less of an online introvert.
+ I started experimenting with Jekyll and static only and want to experiment with it for a blog.

## About the site

This site is built with [Jekyll][jekyll] and the build is managed with [Grunt][grunt], currently hosted on Amazon S3, the source is on [Github](https://github.com/lirsacc/lirsac.me). ~~I am still uploading manually while I tinker with [Travis][travis] and [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website "s3_website") to get *deploy on push*.~~ Push and deploy is now done through git commit hooks and Travis CI.
